  
The MimbleWimble block format builds on this by introducing one additional concept:_cut-through_. With this addition, a MimbleWimble chain gains:

* Further anonymity by mixing and removing transaction data.
* And the ability for new nodes to sync up with the rest of the network very efficiently.
