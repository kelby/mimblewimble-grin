```
X = 113*G + 3*H
```

```
Xi => Y
```

```
Y - Xi = (113*G + 3*H) - (113*G + 3*H) = 0*G + 0*H
```

```
Y - Xi = ((113+28)*G + 3*H) - (113*G + 3*H) = 28*G + 0*H
```

That signature, attached to every transaction, together with some additional data \(like mining fees\), is called a

_transaction kernel_.
