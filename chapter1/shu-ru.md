OutputFeatures

Commitment

block\_hash

MerkleProof

An input must provide -

* the commitment \(to lookup the output in the MMR\)
* the output features \(hash in output MMR dependent on features\|commitment\)
* a merkle proof showing inclusion of the output in the originating block
* the block hash of originating blocks
  * \[tbd - maintain index based on merkle proof?\]
