```rust
/// An easy to manipulate structure holding the 3 sum trees necessary to
/// validate blocks and capturing the Output set, the range proofs and the
/// kernels. Also handles the index of Commitments to positions in the
/// output and range proof pmmr trees.
///
/// Note that the index is never authoritative, only the trees are
/// guaranteed to indicate whether an output is spent or not. The index
/// may have commitments that have already been spent, even with
/// pruning enabled.

pub struct TxHashSet {
	output_pmmr_h: PMMRHandle<OutputIdentifier>,
	rproof_pmmr_h: PMMRHandle<RangeProof>,
	kernel_pmmr_h: PMMRHandle<TxKernel>,

## Extension

```rust
/// Allows the application of new blocks on top of the sum trees in a
/// reversible manner within a unit of work provided by the `extending`
/// function.
pub struct Extension<'a> {

	rproof_pmmr: PMMR<'a, RangeProof, PMMRBackend<RangeProof>>,
	kernel_pmmr: PMMR<'a, TxKernel, PMMRBackend<TxKernel>>,

	commit_index: Arc<ChainStore>,
	new_output_commits: HashMap<Commitment, u64>,
	new_block_markers: HashMap<Hash, BlockMarker>,
	rollback: bool,
}
