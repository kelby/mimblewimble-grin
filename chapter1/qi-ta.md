## ShortId

Short id for identifying inputs/outputs/kernels

可根据 hash 和 nonce 生成。

## OutputIdentifier

```rust
/// An output_identifier can be build from either an input _or_ an output and
/// contains everything we need to uniquely identify an output being spent.
/// Needed because it is not sufficient to pass a commitment around.
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct OutputIdentifier {
	/// Output features (coinbase vs. regular transaction output)
	/// We need to include this when hashing to ensure coinbase maturity can be
	/// enforced.
	pub features: OutputFeatures,
	/// Output commitment
	pub commit: Commitment,
}
```
